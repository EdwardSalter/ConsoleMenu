Here we have a very simple menu that is linked against the keys 1-4. Hitting one of these values will return the given choice.  



![Menu With Default](doc/MenuWithDefault.png)
This menu has a default value set, hitting enter will return you the value at the index notated in the brackets.  



![Menu With Overflow](doc/MenuWithOverflow.png)
This menu has more items than can fit in the standard 1-9 numbered menu therefore an extra item has been added that will take you to the next page.
